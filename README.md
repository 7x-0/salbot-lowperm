## Contributing

- All commits should be structured following conventional commits, notably this means use feat, fix, or chore, with an optional scope with (), use present tense. For example, `fix: improve handling of api requests`, rather than just `fixed handling of api requests`, or `chore(docs): update readme`, rather than `updated readme`
