# SalBot Lowperm

### This is just a low permission Discord bot for entertainment on the SalC1 Discord server.

## Contributing

- All commits should be structured following conventional commits, notably this means use feat, fix, or chore, with an optional scope with (), use present tense. For example, `fix: improve handling of api requests`, rather than just `fixed handling of api requests`, or `chore(docs): update readme`, rather than `updated readme`

- Please make pull requests for each feature, don't make a PR for each commit, and don't make a PR containing 5 features, just one per PR. This way it's easy to tell when anything was added and it makes it easier if we need to revert a specific change. In general, a new cog is a new feature, only create one new cog per PR, and don't update more than one in a PR. Your PRs must have semantic titles, similar to conventional commits.

- Please test your code on a personal server before making a PR, it's your job to ensure your code is working, not ours

- Have fun, this is meant to be a bot that does interesting things, just please keep the repo in pristine condition :)
